		<h2>What is DNA Screening?</h2>
		<img src="http://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/19996.jpeg" alt="genetic testing statistic" class="hookimage col-5">
		<h4 class="normaltext col-7"> Consumer genetic testing is rising in popularity in the United States, but genetic testing and screening are not exactly same, and DNA tests vary from simply ancestry tests, to complex condition-determining tests. DNA screening is a process used to determine someone's risk of developing a disorder, based on their genetics. DNA testing is usually conducted after screening, and it is used to determine whether or not someone actually has a disorder. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The most common reasons people take such tests are to learn whether they have a genetic condition that runs in their family before symptoms appear, to assess the risks of a child developing a genetic condition, to diagnose a genetic condition when they have symptoms, or to understand/guide their cancer prevention or treatment plan.</h4>

			<h2>Different kinds of DNA Testing and Screening</h2>
			<img src="https://images.everydayhealth.com/images/genetic-diseases/genetic-diseases/down-syndrome/down-syndrome-guide-diagnosis-rm-722x406.jpg" class="sectionimage col-5">
			<h4 class="normaltext col-7"> There is an incredibly high amount of different kinds of DNA tests and screenings, but I will write about some of the common ones. 
			<br>
			<br>
			First off, newborn screening. This type of genetic screening is the most commonly done, and it is performed to test newborns for certain genetic and metabolic abnormalities or issues that cause specific conditions. This type of genetic testing is important because if results show there's a disorder that can be treated easily at an early stage, care and treatment can begin right away. An example of such a disorder is congenital hypothyroidism, which is a partial or complete loss of function of the thyroid gland, a tissue in the neck.
			<br> 
			<br>
			Next is carrier testing. This type of test is done when somebody has a genetic disorder in their family tree, or if they are of an ethnicity that has a high risk of genetic disorder. This type of test is usually done before deciding to conceive a child, in order to assess the risk of a genetic disorder for the child.
			<br>
			<br>
			The next type of DNA test is Diagnostic Testing. These types of tests are done when a person has symptoms of a genetic disorder, and the test is used to determine whether or not the person has the suspected disorder.
			<br>
			<br>
			The final type of DNA test I have researched is the prenatal test. This test is done during pregnancy to determine whether or not the child, before birth, is at risk of having, or does have a genetic disorder. Examples of common disorders that are found using this type of DNA tests are down syndrome and trisomy 18 syndrome.
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>What are the Issues with Genetic Screening?</h2>
			<img src="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/images/2015-01_test.jpg" alt="genetic testing image" alt="" class="sectionimage col-4">
			<h4 class="normaltext col-7"> There are actually very few physical risks of DNA Screening, and the ones that exist are extremely minor. There may be some emotional stress or problems simply due to the result of the tests, but physical and emotional damage are not what bring debate to genetic screening and testing. The most common arguments about such testing are rather about the cost, accessibility, and even ethics of genetic testing.
			<br>
			<br>
			Starting with the cost, depending on the type of test, DNA screening can cost anywhere between below $100, and up to $3000+. Although the government cover many sections of healthcare and medical procedures for Canadian citizens, these tests are not covered, and must be paid for by the person themselves. This makes genetic testing hard to access for people who can not afford it. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The ethical values of genetic testing are also a common argument, but there are two major points to be considered. The first thing to consider is the idea of a mandatory genetic test for someone who could be at risk of a genetic condition, or who's children could be at risk. The Canadian law completely prohibits mandatory genetic testing, or being forced to disclose existing results of a genetic test. Under the Genetic Non-Discrimination act, a person is in full control of their personal information. The second ethics-related argument against genetic testing is that genetic testing can reveal the conditions of a family member, who has similar genetics. This is technically a violation of a person's right to not disclose their medical information, but it is also simply an assumption of their condition, rather than truly testing the person. </h4>

			<h2>What are some Initiatives for Accessibility of DNA screening?</h2>
			<img src="http://ccgf-cceg.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CCGF_Logo_235x157.jpg" alt="CCGF" class="sectionimage col-4">
			<h4 class="normaltext col-7"> Of course, as mentioned earlier, the government does not cover fees for genetic testing and screening. This section will cover some of the initiatives and public health measures that are in place, that help make genetic testing accessible for all Canadians. An organization I found was the <a href="http://ccgf-cceg.ca/about-ccgf/">CCGF</a>, A coalition of many groups who take action to fight genetic discrimination in Canada. There are some examples of things this group have helped complete, or completed themselves, such as Passing the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act in  2017, and advocacy to ensure the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act remains law in 2020. </h4>

		<div  class="col-12 section4" id="section4">
			<h2>Why is this Important?</h2>
			<img src="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/sites/lab/files/2018-09/michigan-med-l-aging-gene-01.jpg" alt="genetic testing graphic" class="sectionimage col-4">
			<h4 class="normaltext col-7"> The importance of DNA testing and screening is serious, and the accessibility of tests for people who need them is still an issue in the country. While the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act has been passed, and remains law, people still have very common issues with paying for genetic tests, and maintaining their privacy when they take them. Organizations such as the CCGF exist to battle these unfair cases, but more work needs to be done to ensure accessiblity and privacy in genetic testing in Canada.</h4>
